# MorphLite

Morphlite is an attempt to create a DOM morphing function in less than 100 lines of code to use with [HTMZ](https://leanrada.com/htmz/) in small projects. It is still very much a work-in-progress and probably doesn’t work.

This is my first open source TypeScript project, so I’m still figuring out how to set up the repo.
